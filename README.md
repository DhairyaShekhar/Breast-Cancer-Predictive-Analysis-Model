# Predictive Analysis of Breast Tumor

### Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis and predictive modeling of breast cancer. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to enhance early detection and improve patient outcomes.

Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent and potentially life-threatening diseases affecting women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. In this context, predictive analysis techniques offer valuable tools for identifying patterns and risk factors associated with breast cancer diagnosis.

A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed.

### Key Details
**Objective:** To develop a predictive model capable of accurately classifying breast tumors as malignant or benign based on clinical and diagnostic features. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, we aim to build a robust and reliable model that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding patient care and treatment strategies.

**Data:** The Breast Cancer Dataset is available as machine learning repository maintained by the University of California, Irvine. The dataset is also available in the `Dataset` folder of this repository.

**Algorithms Used:** 
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised learning method for classification.
- ROC Curve

**Focus:** Optimizing recall rates to minimize false negatives.
